# Terraform-Howtos

This  Repo is evolving  and i plan to keep basic scripts for references . 
Prerquisite: 
<br>User has a linux/wundows bare/virtual/contianer system where from terraform can be launched.<br>
<br>Terraform is installed .
<br>IAM  user has  full permission on EC2.
<br>One must know Terraform basics such as terraform init,plan,state,apply,destroy.

Basic Scenarios:
t_ec2) How to spin up /down a basic ubuntu  aws  ec2  server
t_kms_ec2) How to spin up a basic ubuntu server  with keys  adn access it via ssh connection
...... Development.... going on.
