This  Repo is evolving  and i plan to keep basic scripts for references . 
<br>Prerquisite:

<br>user has a linux/windows bare/virtual/contianer system where from terraform can be launched
<br>Terraform is installed .
<br>IAM  user has  full permission on EC2.
<br>One must know Terraform basics such as terraform init,plan,state,apply,destroy.</b>

Basic Scenarios:
